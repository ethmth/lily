# LILY

LILY (Lightweight Integrated List Syntax), is a Programming Language implemented using OCaml.

> :warning: **Repo not fully ready**: The files are not yet ready to be worked on. I (Ethan) will update them soon by copying the NanoC/MicroC examples from class.

Currently, the programming language implementation can be found in the `src/` directory, and examples can be found in the `examples/` directory.

PLEASE DO NOT COMMIT BINARY FILES OR COMMIT DIRECTLY TO THE `main` BRANCH.
